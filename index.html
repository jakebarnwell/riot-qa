		Because this program has to use heuristics to infer which spell so damage and how much damage, this information
		is not guaranteed to be accurate; but it should be close. Note that I did use the API to get all of my data, however,
		I do not actively query it during operation of the program: I store a local copy of the data so that it's more
		reliable to work with.
	</p>

		For the purposes of simpler damage calculation, I make
		some assumptions. The first is that all champions have zero bonus health, armor, etc. (i.e. it's as if they
		don't have any items). The second is that I assume the average enemy champion to have 1950 (the approximate average
		of level 18 healths across the board) health when dealing with skills that scale off of the enemy's health. Next,
		I don't count aoe damage multiple times: for example, I don't multiply Fiddle's ult damage by 5 ("He could potentially
		be damaging the whole entire team!") nor do I do it for Karthus ult, etc. Whenever reasonable, I give the benefit of
		the doubt to the spell doing as much damage as possible. For example, if a spell scales on the enemy's missing health,
		I assume the enemy has 100% (99%?) missing health so that the spell does maximum damage.

		Below are two fields where you can enter your choices of AP, AD, and CDR. You are allowed to enter a CDR of higher
		than 40%.
