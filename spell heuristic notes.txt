Need to get rid of things with "reduced damage":

Grag w (grag takes less damage)
Heim W (each rocket does less) 
Kat e (kat takes reduced dmg after shunpo)
Elise R, R2 (Fix by deleting these from spells considered)
Shen E (enemies he taunts deal reduced dmg)
Amumu E (passive, mummy takes less dmg from auto from pattacks)

Also false positives:
Elise R, R2
Shaco Q


Match {{ xi }}: x.match(/({{ )[eaf0-9]+( }})/g)
Match also % and }}% etc: x.match(/({{ ?)[eaf0-9]+( ?}}\)?%?)/g)
Also match x% directly: x.match(/(({{ ?)[eaf0-9]+( ?}}\)?%?))|([0-9]+%)/g)

Need to also remove "% less damage" debuffs (ori, cait, ez, naut, jax)

Different types of % scalings in damage parsings:
target's maximum health
their current health (enemy)
target's missing health
of its current health (enemy)
of their missing health (enemy)
of bonus health (me)
of braum's max health (me)
of target's current health

of bonus attack damage (me)
bonus base damage (i.e. percent multiple of the base dmg only)

assume multiplicative if otherwise not stated!

Notes on some % damage spells:
khazix not relevant --> remove
nid takedown? remove
lucian Q double counts the % AD --> remove the one that's double counted
